# My opinions on software
Quite possible I missed something in some cases. But if I did, then the sin is the thing not being intuitive enough.

B - BAD

G - GOOD

# MacOS
#### G: Command+` to switch between instances of the same app is helpful.
#### G: Command+C/V/X is consistent over all the apps, which helps mostly in the terminal where Ctrl+C has another historical behavior.
#### G: The dock can be put on the left. I can't believe this is a thing that even need mentioning, but I guess it does in 2024; looking at you, Windows 11.
#### G: The battery is so good. I don't understand how this is real laptop.
#### G: The fingerprint works extremely well and is very convenient to use.
#### G: Camera, mic, speakers are very good.
#### G: Spotlight is pretty good in general.

#### B: Minimizing applications triggers that animation that is annoying and takes too much time. Enabling Reduce Motion in Settings doesn't seem to do help. Update: switching to Scale Effect in Dock settings is slightly better, but not great.
#### B: No easy way to do the equivalent of Win+1/2/3. Some extensions seem to be available.
#### B: Snapping windows so they get full screen/half the screen is not a thing. Windows don't remember their non-fullscreen size after being full screen sometimes.
####  B: The dock is an abomination by default. By default apps that that I just opened once and close stick to it instead of disappearing.
The dot near the app confused me, but after a quick search it seems like it just says where the app is opened or not. Which creates more questions than it answers.

For instance:
- I open a presentation in powerpoint.
- All good. I close the window. PowerPoint is still in dock with a dot near it. Okay, so is it still open? 
- I click on it again. The presentation is not opened, it's just the open page, which makes sense. I close it again.
- The dot is still there. Okay, why? Checking Activity Monitor confirms PowerPoint is still open. 
- WHY? I don't know if this is a MS oopsie or a Dock one. But right clicking and then quit becomes old real quick.
- More testing, and Apple apps like Passwords does the same.

I hate it. Maybe I misunderstand how I should use the Dock, but I would really like to only have the stuff I'm actively using, in the order I want.

Update: Even with "Show suggested and recent apps in Dock" disabled, System Settings seems to just stick around, if it's actually closed (no dot). Options -> Remove from Dock works. Opening and closing it again actually removed it from the Dock now? What?

#### B: Speaking of the Dock, why can I move every other app to another position, but not Finder? Why does it have to be the first?

#### B: I can't tell from the Dock if I have one instance of an app opened or more.

#### B: Finder is a really bad user experience.
Enter is rename. Go back is different than any other software I know and doesn't work on the mouse. I can never know where I am because I have no address bar. I couldn't figure out how to get to my home folder for a long time, until I googled it and found I have to enable it in some settings. I learned by now that I can do Command+Shift+G to get an address bar to just go to some location (which is what I need like 80% of the time), but it's time wasted on something so trivial. I've seen the same folder opened as Icons, as List, and as Columns without me ever changing anything.

#### B: /Users with upper U is quite unfortunate. I like my files without uppercase letters or spaces. To be fair, it's quite a minor offence if we compare it to Windows, but it's still an offence. Thankfully it's very rare that I have to write it manually (which is what my problem actually is).

#### B: The size of the 3 circles for Close/Minimize/Maximize is too small. It's too much effort to pinpoint them exactly to click them. Also the fact that they change apperance when hovered looks bad to me. This wouldn't be a problem in general, but the keyboard shortcuts for Close/Maximize are completely different than the other systems, and I can't trust myself to do them properly.
